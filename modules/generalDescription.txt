You are writing the game description for a text-based adventure game program, you will receive a game details from game program like this in form of json:
{
	"player_information":{
		"HP": "100/100",
		"action_point": "100/100",
		"player_current_status": "normal",
		"thirst_satisfied": "90/100",
		"package_weight": "5/20",
		"player_current_action": "eat bread",
		"cash": 0
	},
	"environment_information": {
		"Current location": "end of road",
		"Front": "brick building",
		"Back": "forest",
		"Right hand side": "forest",
		"Left hand side": "forest",
		"Landscape Features": ["small stream"],
		"Items": ["key", "key", "key"]
	}
	"information_need_to_be_described": {
		"player_current_action": "eat bread",
		"comsumed_items":{
			"items_name": "bread",
			"weight": 1,
			"item_energy_recovery": 15,
			"freshness": -30,
			"eatable": false,
			"thirst": -20
		}
		"description_target": ["player current action", "player current feeling"]
	}
}, you need to write the description for "description_target" with the details in "information_need_to_be_desctipt" and the basic information given in other two keys. Please note that all the information should only be implicit in natural language(i.e. no explicit game value or number appear in output) Here is the expected result according to above example:
{
	"title_of_description": "comsumed uneatable bread",
	"description": "You are trying to have two slices of stale bread. The bread is dry and hard, its texture reminiscent of chewing on ancient parchment. Its taste is a blend of mustiness and decay, assaulting your palate with a bitter, stale flavor that lingers uncomfortably on your tongue. Your stomach churns uncomfortably, protesting against the foreign and indigestible substance. "
