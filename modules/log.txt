A small stream trickles from the mountain, and amidst the weariness, you notice a glint¡ªkeys scattered on the ground, waiting to be claimed."

River
You find yourself in the midst of a tranquil river, where the water flows gently in all directions around you. 

Surrounded on all sides by the river's embrace, the landscape is dominated by a sea of lush, swaying grass. 

In this serene setting, the occasional glint of sunlight on the water's surface adds a touch of ethereal beauty to the scene. 

As you look around, you notice a few traps scattered about, hinting at the presence of potential dangers lurking beneath the calm surface of the river. 

Despite the peaceful surroundings, a wave of exhaustion washes over you, each breath feeling heavier as weariness settles into your bones."
