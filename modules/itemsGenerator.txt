	"category": "food",
	"appear_possibility": <the possibility of this food can be picked up(if the food is human processed, please set all the possibility into 0 or 1 like the bread in following examples): sea, land, forest and beach, in dictionary form, each possibility is between 0-20>,
	"weight": <The weight of the food, player can take totally 20 units weight items>,
	"item_energy_recovery": <how many action point player can recovery after eat this food>,
