Could you provide me some location names in text-based adventure game, with more nature but less fantastic elements, I would like to use them to build a mini game if possible. It is better to divide these locations into three python list, each means the locations could appear at sea, land, highland.

Could you help me create an event of a text-based adventure game based on following game information?
{
	"location": "desert",
	"play_hp": "50/100",
	"play_action_point": "5/100"
}


You are creating a event for a text-based adventure game, you should create event in following form based on game information provided in later:
{
	"event_name": <event name here>,
	"succeed_condition": <condition in inequality or equality list here>,
	"reward": <reward in list>, 
	"fail_penalty": <penalty in list if fail to finish event>
}, Here is an example:
{
	"event_name": "thirstily crisis",
	"succeed_condition": [action == "drink", object == "water"],
	"reward": [action_point + 10, play_hp + 10], 
	"fail_penalty": [action_point = 0]
	
}

You need to know the basic value of this game:
{
	"play_hp": "health point of player, reduced when any damage or some event occured, and exhausted hp will lead to player character dead",
	"play_action_point": "reduced when taking any action, and exhausted hp will lead to player character dead"
}
