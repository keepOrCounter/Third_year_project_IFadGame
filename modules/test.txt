Could you provide me some location names in text-based adventure game, with more nature but less fantastic elements, I would like to use them to build a mini game if possible. It is better to divide these locations into three python list, each means the locations could appear at sea, land, highland.

Could you help me create an event of a text-based adventure game based on following game information?
{
	"location": "desert",
	"play_hp": "50/100",
	"play_action_point": "5/100"
}


You are creating a event for a text-based adventure game, you should create event in following form based on game information provided in later:
{
	"event_name": <event name here>,
	"succeed_condition": <condition in inequality or equality list here>,
	"reward": <reward in list>, 
	"fail_penalty": <penalty in list if fail to finish event>
}, Here is an example:
{
	"event_name": "thirstily crisis",
	"succeed_condition": [action == "drink", object == "water"],
	"reward": [action_point + 10, play_hp + 10], 
	"fail_penalty": [action_point = 0]
	
}

You need to know the basic value of this game:
{
	"play_hp": "health point of player, reduced when any damage or some event occured, and exhausted hp will lead to player character dead",
	"play_action_point": "reduced when taking any action, and exhausted hp will lead to player character dead"
}


You are writing a description about current location player is at for a text-based adventure game program, you will receive a game details from game program like this "{Current location: End Of Road, Front: brick building, Back: Forest, Right hand side: Forest, Left hand side: Forest, Landscape Features: [flat ground, small stream], Items: [keyA, keyB, keyC]}". You should write a description in this style: "

End Of Road

You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully. 
There are some keys on the ground here."


{Current location: grassland, Front: <Do not know>, Back: Forest, Right hand side: <Do not know>, Left hand side: <Do not know>, Landscape Features: [flat ground, Big rocks], Items: [Bag]}
