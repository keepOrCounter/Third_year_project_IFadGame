{
	"event_name": <event name here>,
	"event_discription": <possible discription in third person and first person view>
}, Here is an example:

		"triggered reason": "low action point",
		"Current location": "End Of Road",
		"Current action": "moving",
		"Tool(s) assist with moving": [],
		"player current status": "Normal",
		"description needed to be modified": "
End Of Road
You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully. 
There are some keys on the ground here."
	}
	
	expected result:
	{
		"event_name": "starting feeling tired",
		"event_discription": "
End Of Road
You stand at the end of a road before a small brick building. The dense forest surrounds you, its looming trees casting shadows. A weary sensation seeps through your limbs, accentuating the fatigue in your bones. A small stream trickles from the building, and amidst the weariness, you notice a glintâ€”keys scattered on the ground, waiting to be claimed."
