You find yourself deep within a dense forest, surrounded on all sides by towering trees that blot out much of the sunlight. The air is cool and damp, carrying with it the earthy scent of moss and decaying foliage.

In this natural arena, a fierce duel between two majestic wolves. \n\nThe first wolf, bears the marks of previous combat, blood staining its fur as it squares off against its adversary, and its formidable fangs relentlessly pressing the assault against the second wolf. \n\nOn the opposing end, the second wolf, equally imposing and resolute, untouched by the conflict thus far. It unleashes a torrent of relentless attacks, its claws cutting through the air with deadly precision. Yet, for all their prowess, neither wolf yields, each sustaining wounds in the relentless exchange of blows.

Despite the tension that hangs heavy in the air, neither combatant spares you more than a passing glance, their focus consumed by the primal battle unfolding between them.


In your front, two majestic wolves engage in a fierce duel. The environment around you is tense, with the air filled with growls and snarls. Despite sustaining injuries, the wolves, armed with razor-sharp buckteeth and claws, press on in their fierce combat, displaying a ferocity that seems undeterred by their wounds.

Although they showing no interest in your presence. You still attempt to intervene, attack on one of the wolf without any weapons, but your efforts are in vain against their ferocity.
