There are some stuffs floating in the water here, including a first aid kit and some edible plants."

All seems well on the surface, except for one persistent sensation: thirst. Your throat is dry and parched, a constant reminder of your unquenched longing for water.

Clad in an old shirt, you stand with empty hands, contemplating the need for some form of protection in this unforgiving environment.

You have 10 units of currency in your pocket.

With a heavy heart, you open your package, revealing its contents: a weighty, decaying fish. The stench of its staleness fills the air, rendering it inedible.
